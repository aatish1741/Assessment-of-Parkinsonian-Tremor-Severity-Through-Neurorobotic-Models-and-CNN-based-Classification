# Assessment-of-Parkinsonian-Tremor-Severity-Through-Neurorobotic-Models-and-CNN-based-Classification


## Project Overview

This project extends and builds upon previous work (specifically Timothé Petitjean’s thesis) by developing a comprehensive **neurorobotics computational framework** for **Parkinson's Disease (PD)**. The work combines **computational modeling** of the **Basal Ganglia–Thalamo–Cortical (BG-T-C)** loop, **sensorimotor integration** with the **iCub robot simulator**, **feature extraction** from joint movement data, and the application of **deep learning models (CNNs)** to classify Parkinsonian severity levels.

The project is divided into three main stages:

- **Prototype 1:** Replication of closed-loop DBS control using the BG-T-C computational model.
- **Prototype 2:** Sensorimotor integration of the iCub robot with tremor simulation and closed-loop DBS interventions.
- **Prototype 3:** Feature engineering of robotic kinematic data and CNN-based severity classification.

## Docker

To build the Docker container:
```bash
cd docker
bash build-docker.sh
```

If running for the first time, compile the `.mod` files by running:
```bash
nrnivmodl
```

## Computational Model

The computational model needs to be launched outside from the docker.

Download the necessary packages in the requirements.txt beforehand.

To run the computational model:
```bash
python MarmosetBG.py
```

## Launch Gazebo Simulation

Install and compile the [robotology superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild) before starting simulation.

To launch the Gazebo iCub simulation, first initiate the yarp server:
```bash
yarpserver
```

Then in another Command window launch the gazebo simulation:
```bash
gazebo tutorial_joint-interface.sdf
```

# Additional Contributions

## Sensorimotor Loop Integration
The iCub simulator is connected to the computational model to create a full sensorimotor feedback loop, allowing dynamic modulation of motor behavior based on simulated Parkinsonian neural signals.

## Data Extraction
From the iCub simulations, kinematic data including joint angles, joint velocities, tremor amplitude, and frequency are collected to represent motor symptoms.

## Feature Engineering
Critical features such as joint velocity, angular acceleration, tremor frequency, and amplitude are extracted from the raw time-series data to create clean machine learning-ready datasets.

## MANOVA Statistical Validation
A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) is performed to statistically confirm that the engineered kinematic features significantly differ across different Parkinsonian severity conditions (Healthy, PD without DBS, PD with DBS).

## CNN-based Severity Classification
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed, trained, and validated to classify Parkinsonian severity levels based on the engineered features. Model evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
